Revision history for Net-IMAP-Server

0.4    Fri Apr 11 15:29:15 2008
        * Weaken the timeout callback, so we don't leak connection
          objects
        * Don't double-store refs to connections
        * Actually clean out old keys in the connection hash
        * Try to print from the right coro, so EV doesn't complain
          about recursive entry, and then wedge the next time it
          happens.
        * Drop some more 'cede's in for commands which do many things

0.3    Tue Mar 11 12:33:14 2008
        * Connections weren't being fully closed on timeout

0.2    Mon Mar 10 16:47:52 2008
        * Initial release to CPAN
