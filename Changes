Revision history for Net-IMAP-Server

1.13   Fri Mar 20 14:11:17 2009
        * More UNSEEN fixes; the UNSEEN reported by STATUS and the
          UNSEEN reported by SELECT are different beasts, and have
          been split into different methods.

1.12   Tue Mar 10 13:46:17 2009
        * Ensure that mailboxes passed to CREATE aren't trying to
          encode things they shouldn't be, by round-tripping and
          comparing.
        * Match query in LIST and LSUB against encoded path, not raw
          utf8 path
        * Support for adding new commands via 'add_command' in
          Net::IMAP::Server

1.11   Fri Mar  6 14:20:17 2009
        * Move IMAP-UTF-7 handling into model's ->split, so it runs
          for _all_ client-given input.  Then adjust ->handle_command
          to be able to send specific messages to the client on some
          exceptions.  Reported by Jan Dvorak
          <jdvorak@uikt.mendelu.cz>.
        * Add a case for the suspected edge case where a timeout or
          printing error is discovered while handling a command
        * Upper-case command name in "command not recognized" to not
          leak implementation as much

1.10   Thu Mar  5 14:27:17 2009
        * Fix a major bug where UNSEEN reported the total number of
          unseen messages in the mailbox, rather than the sequence of
          the first unseen message.  Reported by Jan Dvorak
          <jdvorak@uikt.mendelu.cz>
        * Always return un-decoded headers to the client.  Reported by
          Jan Dvorak <jdvorak@uikt.mendelu.cz>
        * Fixes for people who have set $" to something odd

1.08   Tue Feb 24 16:27:17 2009
        * UTF-7 support for mailbox naming

        * Added some missing pod on Net::IMAP::Server::DefaultModel

0.4    Wed Apr 23 15:24:22 2008
        * Weaken the timeout callback, so we don't leak connection
          objects
        * Don't double-store refs to connections
        * Actually clean out old keys in the connection hash
        * Try to print from the right coro, so EV doesn't complain
          about recursive entry, and then wedge the next time it
          happens.
        * Drop some more 'cede's in for commands which do many things
