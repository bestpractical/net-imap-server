0.4    Wed Apr 23 15:24:22 2008
        * Weaken the timeout callback, so we don't leak connection
          objects
        * Don't double-store refs to connections
        * Actually clean out old keys in the connection hash
        * Try to print from the right coro, so EV doesn't complain
          about recursive entry, and then wedge the next time it
          happens.
        * Drop some more 'cede's in for commands which do many things
