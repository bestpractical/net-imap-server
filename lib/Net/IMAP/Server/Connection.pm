=head1 NAME

Net::IMAP::Server::Connection - Connection to a client

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Maintains all of the state for a client connection to the IMAP server.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new connection; the server will take care of this step.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self  = $class->SUPER::new(
        {   @_,
            state           => "unauth",
            _unsent_expunge => [],
            _unsent_fetch   => {},
            last_poll       => time,
            commands        => 0,
            coro            => $Coro::current,
            _session_flags  => {},
        }
    );
    $self->update_timer;
    return $self;
}

=head2 server

Returns the L<Net::IMAP::Server> that this connection is on.

=head2 coro

Returns the L<Coro> process associated with this connection.  For
things interacting with this connection, it will probably be the
current coroutine, except for interactions coming from event loops.

=head2 io_handle

Returns the IO handle that can be used to read from or write to the
client.

=head2 model

Gets or sets the L<Net::IMAP::Server::DefaultModel> or descendant
associated with this connection.  Note that connections which have not
authenticated yet do not have a model.

=head2 auth

Gets or sets the L<Net::IMAP::Server::DefaultAuth> or descendant
associated with this connection.  Note that connections which have not
authenticated yet do not have an auth object.

=cut

sub auth {
    my $self = shift;
    if (@_) {
        $self->{auth} = shift;
        $self->server->model_class->require || $self->log(1, $@);
        $self->update_timer;
        $self->model(
            $self->server->model_class->new( { auth => $self->{auth} } ) );
    }
    return $self->{auth};
}

=head2 client_id

When called with no arguments, returns a hashref of identifying
information provided by the client.  When key-value pairs are
provided, sets the client properties.  See RFC 2971.

=cut

sub client_id {
    my $self = shift;
    if (@_ > 1) {
        $self->{client} = {%{$self->{client} || {}}, @_};
    }
    return $self->{client} || {};
}

=head2 selected [MAILBOX], [READ_ONLY]

Gets or sets the currently selected mailbox for this connection.
Changing mailboxes triggers the sending of untagged notifications to
the client, as well as calling L<Net::IMAP::Server::Mailbox/close> and
L<Net::IMAP::Server::Mailbox/select>.

=cut

sub selected {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($mailbox, $read_only) = @_;

    # This is just being called as a getter
    return $self->_selected unless @_;

    # This is a setter, but isn't actually changing the mailbox, nor
    # changing the read-only-ness.
    return $self->_selected if ($mailbox || "") eq ($self->_selected || "")
        and ($self->selected_read_only || 0) == ($read_only || 0);

    # Otherwise, flush any untagged messages, close the old, and open
    # the new.
    $self->send_untagged;
    $self->_selected->close if $self->_selected;
    $self->_selected( $mailbox );
    if ($self->_selected) {
        $self->selected_read_only( $read_only );
        $self->_selected->select;
    }

    return $self->_selected;
}

=head2 selected_read_only

Returns true of the currently selected mailbox has been forced into
read-only mode.  Note that the mailbox may be read-only for other
reasons, so checking L<Net::IMAP::Server::Mailbox/read_only> is
suggested instead.

=head2 greeting

Sends out a one-line untagged greeting to the client.

=cut

sub greeting {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->untagged_response('OK IMAP4rev1 Server');
}

=head2 handle_lines

The main line handling loop.  Since we are using L<Coro>, this cedes
to other coroutines whenever we block, given them a chance to run.  We
additionally cede after handling every command.

=cut

sub handle_lines {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->coro->prio(-4);

    eval {
        $self->greeting;
        while ( $self->io_handle and $_ = $self->io_handle->getline() ) {
            $self->handle_command($_);
            $self->commands( $self->commands + 1 );
            if (    $self->is_unauth
                and $self->server->unauth_commands
                and $self->commands >= $self->server->unauth_commands )
            {
                $self->out(
                    "* BYE Don't noodle around so much before logging in!");
                last;
            }
            $self->update_timer;
            cede;
        }

        $self->log( 4,
            "-(@{[$self]},@{[$self->auth ? $self->auth->user : '???']},@{[$self->is_selected ? $self->selected->full_path : 'unselected']}): Connection closed by remote host"
        );
    };
    my $err = $@;
    $self->log(1, $err)
        if $err and not( $err eq "Error printing\n" or $err eq "Timeout\n" );
    eval { $self->out("* BYE Idle timeout; I fell asleep.") if $err eq "Timeout\n"; };
    $self->close;
}

=head2 update_timer

Updates the inactivity timer.

=cut

sub update_timer {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->timer->stop if $self->timer;
    $self->timer(undef);
    my $weakself = $self;
    weaken($weakself);
    my $timeout = sub {
        $weakself->coro->throw("Timeout\n");
        $weakself->coro->ready;
    };
    if ( $self->is_unauth and $self->server->unauth_idle ) {
        $self->timer( EV::timer $self->server->unauth_idle, 0, $timeout );
    } elsif ( $self->server->auth_idle ) {
        $self->timer( EV::timer $self->server->auth_idle, 0, $timeout );
    }
}

=head2 timer [EV watcher]

Returns the L<EV> watcher in charge of the inactivity timer.

=head2 commands

Returns the number of client commands the connection has processed.

=head2 handle_command

Handles a single line from the client.  This is not quite the same as
handling a command, because of client literals and continuation
commands.  This also handles dispatch of client commands to
L<Net::IMAP::Server::Command> subclasses (see L</class_for>).

Any errors generated while running commands will cause a C<NO Server
error> to be sent to the client -- unless the error message starts
with C<NO> or c<BAD>, in which case it will be relayed to the client.

Returns the L<Net::IMAP::Server::Command> instance that was run, or
C<undef> if it was a continuation line or pending interactive command.

=cut

sub handle_command {
    my $self    = shift;
    my $content = shift;

    my $output = $content;
    $output =~ s/[\r\n]+$//;

        return;

=head2 pending

If a connection has pending state, contains the callback that will
receive the next line of input.

}

=head2 last_poll

Gets or sets the last time the selected mailbox was polled, in seconds
since the epoch.

=head2 previous_exists

The high-water mark of how many messages the client has been told are
in the mailbox.

=head2 send_untagged

=head2 get_messages STR

=head2 capability

Returns the current capability list for this connection, as a string.
Connections not under TLS or SSL always have the C<LOGINDISABLED>
capability, and no authentication capabilities.  The
L<Net::IMAP::Server/auth_class>'s
L<Net::IMAP::Server::DefaultAuth/sasl_provides> method is used to list

Sends the message to the client.  If the client's connection has
