NAME
    Net::IMAP::Server - A single-threaded multiplexing IMAP server
    implementation, using Net::Server::Coro.

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::IMAP::Server;
      Net::IMAP::Server->new(
          port        => 193,
          ssl_port    => 993,
          auth_class  => "Your::Auth::Class",
          model_class => "Your::Model::Class",
          user        => "nobody",
          group       => "nobody",
      )->run;

DESCRIPTION
    This model provides a complete implementation of the "RFC 3501"
    specification, along with several IMAP4rev1 extensions. It provides
    separation of the mailbox and message store from the client interaction
    loop.

    Note that, following RFC suggestions, login is not allowed except under
    a either SSL or TLS. Thus, you are required to have a certs/ directory
    under the current working directory, containing files server-cert.pem
    and "server-key.pem". Failure to do so will cause the server to fail to
    start.

INTERFACE
    The primary method of using this module is to supply your own model and
    auth classes, which inherit from Net::IMAP::Server::DefaultModel and
    Net::IMAP::Server::DefaultAuth. This allows you to back your messages
    from arbitrary data sources, or provide your own authorization backend.
    For the most part, the implementation of the IMAP components should be
    opaque.

METHODS
  new PARAMHASH
    Creates a new IMAP server object. This doesn't even bind to the sockets;
    it merely initializes the object. It will "die" if it cannot find the
    appropriate certificate files. Valid arguments to "new" include:

    port
        The port to bind to. Defaults to port 1430.

    ssl_port
        The port to open an SSL listener on; by default, this is disabled,
        and any true value enables it.

    auth_class
        The name of the class which implements authentication. This must be
        a subclass of Net::IMAP::Server::DefaultAuth.

    model_class
        The name of the class which implements the model backend. This must
        be a subclass of Net::IMAP::Server::DefaultModel.

    connection_class
        On rare occasions, you may wish to subclass the connection class;
        this class must be a subclass of Net::IMAP::Server::Connection.

    user
        The name or ID of the user that the server should run as; this
        defaults to the current user. Note that privileges are dropped after
        binding to the port and reading the certificates, so escalated
        privileges should not be needed. Running as your "nobody" user or
        equivilent is suggested.

    group
        The name or ID of the group that the server should run as; see
        "user", above.

    poll_every
        How often the current mailbox should be polled, in seconds; defaults
        to 0, which means it will be polled after every client command.

    unauth_commands
        The number of commands before unauthenticated users are
        disconnected. The default is 10; set to zero to disable.

    unauth_idle
        How long, in seconds, to wait before disconnecting idle connections
        which have not authenticated yet. The default is 5 minutes; set to
        zero to disable (which is not advised).

    auth_idle
        How long, in seconds, to wait before disconnecting authentiated
        connections. By RFC specification, this must be longer than 30
        minutes. The default is an hour; set to zero to disable.

  run
    Starts the server; this method shouldn't be expected to return. Within
    this method, $Net::IMAP::Server::Server is set to the object that this
    was called on; thus, all IMAP objecst have a way of referring to the
    server -- and though "connection", whatever parts of the IMAP internals
    they need.

  process_request
    Accepts a client connection; this method is needed for the Net::Server
    infrastructure.

  DESTROY
    On destruction, ensure that we close all client connections and
    listening sockets.

  connections
    Returns an arrayref of Net::IMAP::Server::Connection objects which are
    currently connected to the server.

  connection
    Returns the currently active Net::IMAP::Server::Connection object, if
    there is one. This is determined by examining the current coroutine.

  concurrent_mailbox_connections [MAILBOX]
    This can be called as either a class method or an instance method; it
    returns the set of connections which are concurrently connected to the
    given mailbox object (which defaults to the current connection's
    selected mailbox)

  concurrent_user_connections [USER]
    This can be called as either a class method or an instance method; it
    returns the set of connections whose "user" in
    Net::IMAP::Server::DefaultAuth is the same as the given USER (which
    defaults to the current connection's user)

  capability
    Returns the "CAPABILITY" string for the server. This string my be
    modified by the connection before being sent to the client (see
    "capability" in Net::IMAP::Server::Connection).

  id
    Returns a hash of properties to be conveyed to the client, should they
    ask the server's identity.

DEPENDENCIES
    Coro, Net::Server::Coro
